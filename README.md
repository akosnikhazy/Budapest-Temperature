# Budapest-Temperature
A small script to visualize Budapest's historical temperature data

I stumbled upon this dataset: https://www.met.hu/eghajlat/magyarorszag_eghajlata/eghajlati_adatsorok/Budapest/adatok/napi_adatok/index.php

So I decided to visualize the data. It turned out rather nice, but did not put too much brain power in it, so the code is lazy and the color ranges are not really scientific. For example green is the temperate that I enjoy :D 

But you get the idea.
